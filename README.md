- Sent emails are visible in the **Outlook "Sent Items"** folder (unlike SMTP-based emails).
- Reply Recipients Address can be configured
- Email can be sent either through Plain Format or HTML Format

### ðŸ’¾ 2. Save Outlook Emails as `.msg` Files
- Extract and store Outlook emails in **`.msg` format** for archiving or later processing.

---

### ðŸ“‚ 3. Move Outlook Emails

- Useful for organizing and managing mail flow after processing.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip1:** Use `win32com.client` in Python to interact with Outlook objects such as `MailItem`, `Namespace`, and `MAPIFolder`.
> ðŸ’¡ **Tip2:** Use `os.startfile('outlook')` from the os library in Python to ensure the Outlook application is properly initialized and synchronized before sending emails. Sometimes, emails sent using email_object.Send() may get stuck in the Outbox if Outlook isnâ€™t fully synced. Launching Outlook via os.startfile('outlook') helps avoid this issue by ensuring the client is active and connected.
